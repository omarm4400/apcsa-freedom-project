This month, I began working with Unity for the first time. After figuring out how to install it on my laptop, I explored the interface by watching tutorials directly in the Unity app. I started experimenting by adding a background Unity offers built in options, but I also learned how to download custom ones online. I added a ground layer next, which I expected to be difficult but turned out to be surprisingly simple. I also placed a few objects in the scene to start shaping the simulation. Overall, Unity felt intuitive and beginner-friendly, even for someone using it for the first time.

In the following week, I continued watching tutorials and learned how to make the character move using the arrow keys. I also added sound effects one plays when the character touches a star, and another runs continuously in the background. These features helped bring the simulation to life and made the environment more interactive. I don't have a link to anything because everything I learned was inside the unity app.

I chose Unity because it’s one of the most powerful and accessible platforms for building realistic simulations. Since I’m interested in studying aviation, Unity gives me a way to explore flight mechanics, 3D environments, and user controls all of which are essential in aviation training and game development. It’s also widely used in professional flight simulators and aerospace visualization tools, so learning Unity now helps me build skills that connect directly to my future.
# Engineering design process:
Right now I am in the first step of the EDP, which is to define the proplem. A proplem that I could face now is to keep up with learning my tool and not to skip my learning log any week and to try new stuff so I have a better way to learn.
# Skills:
To learn Unity, I’m using basic skills that are actually really important. I use focus and attention to detail when following tutorials and trying out new tools. My problem solving skills help me figure things out when something doesn’t work right or when I’m trying to add new features. I also use logic and planning to understand how movement, sound, and objects work together in the simulation. Even simple things like typing code, organizing the scene, and testing changes help me build confidence and learn how digital systems respond to input. These basic skills make it easier to learn Unity and prepare me for more advanced projects
