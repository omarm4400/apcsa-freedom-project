### 10/20/25:
* after finally finding out how to add unity to my labtop, I've watched some totorials on the unity app to see how things work, and after watching it I tried some things. The first thing I added was the back ground which unity gives you some to choose from but you can download it online, another thing was the ground, wich i thought it will be hard but it turned out to be so easy and then I added some objects.
So I think for first time using it, unity is so easy to learn.

### 11/2/25:
* This week I continued watching the unity tutorials and I learned some new things, for example I learned how to make the charecter move using the arrow keys. I also learned how to add sound effects. for example when the charecter touches a star as you see in the screenshot it makes a sound effect. there is also a background sound effect that is runing all the time.
